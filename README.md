# Practice contributing to open source by fixing bugs and making bugs for others to fix!

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/IntentionallyBuggyCode/intentionally-buggy-code.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/IntentionallyBuggyCode/intentionally-buggy-code)

Step 1 - fork this project

Step 2 - clone your fork

Step 3 - set remote upstream (i.e. git remote add upstream https://github.com/IntentionallyBuggyCode/intentionally-buggy-code.git)

Step 4 - create and checkout new local branch (i.e. git checkout mynewfeature, git checkout janedoe)

Step 5 - fix a bug / make a bug / etc on the branch of your fork

Step 6 - git commit (please add an useful message)

Step 7 - git push origin janedoe (this will push changes to the branch on your fork on your github account)

Step 8 - go to the intentionally-buggy-code github page (upstream, not your fork), and create a pull request, comparing the upstream master branch to the branch you created on your fork.

If you'd prefer to instead use the command line for pull request, do <code>git push upstream master</code>

To sync your master branch with upstream..  git checkout master, then git pull.
